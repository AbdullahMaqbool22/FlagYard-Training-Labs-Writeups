### Write-up: Matryoksha Doll Challenge

**Challenge Overview:**
The Matryoksha Doll challenge required participants to analyze 13 MKV files to uncover a hidden flag. The challenge presented a unique opportunity to explore multimedia files and the potential data they may contain beyond what is visually apparent.

**Objective:**
The primary objective was to find a specific flag embedded within the MKV files, requiring a combination of file exploration, media analysis, and keen observation.

**Approach:**

1. **Download and Setup:**
   I started by downloading VLC media player, known for its robust capabilities in handling various multimedia formats, including MKV files. This tool was chosen for its ability to play multiple files simultaneously, allowing for easier navigation through the series of MKV files.

2. **Opening the Files:**
   After installing VLC, I opened all 13 MKV files at once. This allowed me to watch them sequentially without the need to manually open each file, making the process more efficient.

3. **Playback and Observation:**
   I carefully observed the playback of each file, looking for any anomalies or distinct content. The files were played in quick succession, maintaining focus on the visuals and audio to catch any subtle hints that could point to the flag.

4. **Discovery of the Flag:**
   Upon reaching **Matryoksha(9).mkv**, I noticed something unusual at the **24-second mark**. A text appeared on the screen, which turned out to be the flag. The flag read: **FlagY{my_font_amazing_isnt_it}**. This moment was thrilling as it was the culmination of careful observation and analysis of the video content.

**Conclusion:**
The Matryoksha Doll challenge was not just about retrieving a flag; it involved utilizing multimedia tools and honing observational skills. By effectively leveraging VLC media player's features, I was able to discover the flag hidden in the MKV files. This experience reinforced the importance of patience and attention to detail in cybersecurity challenges, particularly those involving digital media.
